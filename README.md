# Project-Metro-Interstate
Python data visualization project

This is project called Metro Interstate. It is one of the dataquest.io guided projects. You can find data that I used [here](http://bioinf-mw.bihz.upwr.edu.pl/students-data/Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv).

We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94). The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.

The [dataset documentation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume) mentions that a station located approximately midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul recorded the traffic data. Also, the station only records westbound traffic (cars moving from east to west). This means that the results of our analysis will be about the westbound traffic in the proximity of that station. In other words, we should avoid generalizing our results for the entire I-94 highway.
